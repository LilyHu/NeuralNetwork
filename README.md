# NeuralNetwork - Library implementing a neural network 

A library that defines a NeuralNetwork class is implemented using python numpy in <a href="NeuralNetwork.py">NeuralNetwork.py</a>. Training is done via backpropagation. 

The NeuralNetwork class is demonstrated by training it to recognize handwritten digits (the MNIST dataset) in <a href="NeuralNetwork-RecognizingHandwrittenDigitsDemo.ipynb"> NeuralNetwork-RecognizingHandwrittenDigitsDemo.ipynb <a>.
