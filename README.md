# NeuralNetwork - Library implementing a neural network 

NeuralNetwork.py is a library that defines a NeuralNetwork class using numpy. Training is done via backpropagation. 

NeuralNetwork-demo.ipynb demonstrates the library by training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (the MNIST dataset).
